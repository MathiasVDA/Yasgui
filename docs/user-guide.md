## What is SPARQL?

**SPARQL** (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is the standard query language for retrieving and manipulating data stored in RDF (Resource Description Framework) format. Think of it as SQL for linked data and knowledge graphs.

### Basic Concepts

- **Triples**: RDF data is organized as subject-predicate-object statements
- **URIs**: Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
- **Prefixes**: Shortcuts for long URIs (e.g., `foaf:` for `http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/`)
- **Endpoints**: Web services that accept SPARQL queries

### Learning SPARQL

For a comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide to SPARQL, visit:
**[https://kvistgaard.github.io/sparql/](https://kvistgaard.github.io/sparql/)**

This excellent resource covers:
- SPARQL syntax and structure
- Query types (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK, DESCRIBE)
- Filters and functions
- Real-world examples and exercises

### Common SPARQL Query Types

- **SELECT**: Returns a table of results (like SQL SELECT)
- **CONSTRUCT**: Creates new RDF triples from query results
- **ASK**: Returns true/false for whether a pattern exists
- **DESCRIBE**: Returns all information about a resource

---

## Getting Started

### Accessing YASGUI

YASGUI is available at: **[https://yasgui.matdata.eu/](https://yasgui.matdata.eu/)**

### Running YASGUI with Docker

You can run YASGUI locally using Docker, which is especially useful when working with local SPARQL endpoints.

**Why Use Docker?**
- Avoids browser mixed content restrictions when querying local endpoints
- No need to grant browser permissions for local network access
- Self-contained environment with all dependencies included
- Easy to set up and run

**Running YASGUI:**

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 mathiasvda/yasgui
```

This command:
- Downloads the YASGUI Docker image (first run only)
- Starts YASGUI on port 8080
- Makes it accessible at `http://localhost:8080`

**Accessing YASGUI:**
- Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`
- YASGUI will load and be ready to use
- You can now query local endpoints without browser permission prompts

**Benefits for Local Endpoints:**
- Both YASGUI and your local endpoint use HTTP (no mixed content issues)
- No browser security prompts
- Seamless connection to localhost services
- See [Querying Local Endpoints](#querying-local-endpoints) for more details

**Stopping YASGUI:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Docker is running
- Or use: `docker stop <container-id>`

**Custom Port:**
To run on a different port (e.g., 3000):
```bash
docker run -p 3000:8080 mathiasvda/yasgui
```
Then access at `http://localhost:3000`

### Your First Query

1. **Select an Endpoint**: Enter a SPARQL endpoint URL in the endpoint field (or use the default)
2. **Write a Query**: Type your SPARQL query in the editor
3. **Execute**: Click the "Execute" button or press `Ctrl+Enter`
4. **View Results**: Results appear in the results viewer below

**Example Query:**
```sparql
SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object
WHERE {
  ?subject ?predicate ?object
}
LIMIT 10
```

### Saving Your Work

YASGUI automatically saves:
- Your queries in local storage
- Tab configurations
- User preferences (theme, layout, etc.)

Your work persists across browser sessions on the same device.

### Querying Local Endpoints

YASGUI can query SPARQL endpoints running on your local machine (e.g., Apache Jena Fuseki, GraphDB). However, browsers require special permission to access local servers from web applications.

**Steps to Query Local Endpoints:**

1. **Enter Local Endpoint URL**: Add your local endpoint to the endpoint input box
   - Example: `http://localhost:3030/g/`
   - Example: `http://127.0.0.1:3030/dataset/query`

2. **Execute Your Query**: Click Execute or press `Ctrl+Enter`

3. **Grant Browser Permission**: Your browser will show a permission request to access the local endpoint

   **In Microsoft Edge:**
   
   ![Permission request dialog](img/local_endpoint_msedge_permission_request.png)
   
   - Click **"Allow"** to grant permission
   - The permission applies for the domain on which you run yasgui (for example https://yasgui.matdata.eu/)

4. **If You Blocked the Request**: You can change the permission later

   ![Change permission settings](img/local_endpoint_msedge_permission_change.png)
   
   - Click the lock icon in the address bar
   - Find the "Local network access" or similar setting
   - Change it to "Allow"
   - Execute the query again

5. **Permission Denied Error**: If same-origin policy was not accepted, you'll see an error

   ![Permission denied error](img/local_endpoint_msedge_error.png)
   
   - Follow step 4 to grant permission
   - Re-execute your query

**Other Browsers:**

The process is similar in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari:
- Chrome: the same as Edge (verified by author)
- Firefox: May require setting `security.mixed_content.block_active_content` to false in about:config (unverified by author)
- Safari: Check "Disable local file restrictions" in Develop menu (unverified by author)
- Vivaldi: the same as Edge (verified by author)

**Alternative: Use Docker to Avoid Permission Issues**

If you frequently work with local endpoints, consider running YASGUI locally with Docker:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 mathiasvda/yasgui
```
Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

This eliminates browser permission prompts since both YASGUI and your local endpoint use HTTP. See [Running YASGUI with Docker](#running-yasgui-with-docker) for details.

**Important Notes:**
- Permission is required because YASGUI is served over HTTPS while your local endpoint uses HTTP
- This is a browser security feature to protect against mixed content attacks
- You'll need to grant permission once and it should apply for all browser session (when you don't clear cache & settings)
- Consider using HTTPS for your local endpoint for automatic permission

**Troubleshooting Local Endpoints:**
- Ensure your local SPARQL server is running before querying
- Check that the port number is correct (e.g., 3030, 3333, 7200)
- Verify the endpoint path matches your server configuration
- See [Troubleshooting - Local Endpoint Issues](#local-endpoint-issues) for more help

**System Theme Detection:**

If you haven't manually selected a theme, YASGUI will:
1. Check your system's color scheme preference
2. Apply dark theme if your system prefers dark mode
3. Apply light theme otherwise
4. Automatically update if you change your system preference

### Layout Orientation

YASGUI offers two layout options to optimize screen space:

**Vertical Layout (Default):**
- Query editor on top
- Results viewer below
- Best for standard monitors and laptops

**Horizontal Layout:**
- Query editor on left
- Results viewer on right (side-by-side)
- Ideal for wide/ultrawide monitors
- Maximizes vertical space for both components

**How to Change Layout:**
- Click the layout toggle button in the control bar (next to the endpoint selector)
- Icon shows stacked rectangles (vertical) or side-by-side rectangles (horizontal)
- Layout preference is saved automatically

### Query Formatting

Keep your SPARQL queries clean and readable with automatic formatting.

**Features:**
- Format button in the editor toolbar
- Keyboard shortcut: `Shift+Ctrl+F`
- Choice of formatting engines:
  - **sparql-formatter** (default): Standards-compliant, modern formatter
  - **Legacy formatter**: Original YASGUI formatter
- Auto-format on query execution (configurable in Settings)

**How to Format:**
1. Write or paste your query
2. Click the format button or press `Shift+Ctrl+F`
3. Query is automatically reformatted with proper indentation and spacing

**Configuration:**
- Open Settings (⚙ icon) to:
  - Select your preferred formatter
  - Enable/disable auto-format on query execution
  - Both settings are saved persistently

### CONSTRUCT Query Validation

YASGUI helps you write correct CONSTRUCT queries by detecting undefined variables.

**Feature:**
- Automatically checks if variables used in the CONSTRUCT template are defined in the WHERE clause
- Shows orange warning markers in the gutter for undefined variables
- Displays tooltips explaining which variable is undefined
- Does not prevent query execution (informational only)

**How It Works:**
When you write a CONSTRUCT query, YASGUI analyzes the variables:
```sparql
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
CONSTRUCT {
  ?s ex:hasName ?name .
  ?s ex:hasAge ?age .      # ⚠️ Warning: ?age not defined in WHERE
}
WHERE {
  ?s ex:name ?name .       # Only ?s and ?name are defined
}
```

**Visual Feedback:**
- **Orange warning icon**: Appears in the gutter next to lines with undefined variables
- **Tooltip**: Hover over the warning icon to see which variable is undefined
- **Non-blocking**: Queries can still be executed even with warnings

**Configuration:**
- Open Settings (⚙ icon) → Editor tab
- Toggle "Validate CONSTRUCT query variables" checkbox
- Enabled by default
- Setting is saved persistently

**Why This Helps:**
- Catch typos in variable names early
- Ensure CONSTRUCT queries will produce expected results
- Understand which variables are actually bound in your query
- Improve query quality without blocking execution

### Code Snippets

Quickly insert common SPARQL patterns and query types using the code snippets bar.

**Features:**
- **Quick insertion**: Click a snippet button to insert code at your cursor position
- **Default snippets**: Includes 5 useful SPARQL snippets (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK, FILTER, OPTIONAL)
- **Dropdown grouping**: When more than 10 snippets are configured, they are grouped in dropdown menus
- **Customizable**: Developers can configure custom snippets
- **Visibility toggle**: Show or hide the snippets bar based on preference

**How to Use:**
1. Position your cursor where you want to insert code

- **Auto-capture**: YASGUI automatically captures new prefixes from your queries
- **PREFIX Button**: Insert saved prefixes into your query with one click
- **Prefix Autocomplete**: Type a prefix (e.g., `PREFIX foaf:`) and YASGUI suggests the full URI from prefix.cc

**Default Prefixes:**
YASGUI includes standard prefixes like:
- `rdf:` - RDF vocabulary
- `rdfs:` - RDF Schema

**How to Use:**
1. Click the "PREFIX" button to insert all saved prefixes
2. Open Settings (⚙) to manage your prefix collection
3. Enable/disable auto-capture in Settings

**Auto-completion:**
When typing a prefix declaration, YASGUI queries [prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc) to suggest standard URIs:
```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <  # Auto-suggests http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
```

### Endpoint Quick Switch

The endpoint quick switch buttons feature allows you to quickly switch between different SPARQL endpoints with a single click. You can use predefined endpoints or add your own custom buttons.

**Features:**
- **One-click switching**: Instantly switch to a different SPARQL endpoint
- **Predefined buttons**: Administrators can configure endpoint buttons during initialization
- **User-defined buttons**: Add your own custom endpoint buttons through the Settings interface
- **Persistent storage**: Custom buttons are saved in local storage and persist across sessions

Custom buttons appear alongside predefined buttons and persist across browser sessions. You can remove custom buttons by clicking the × button next to each entry.

**How to Switch Endpoints:**
- Buttons are displayed next to the endpoint textbox in the control bar
- Click any endpoint button to immediately update the endpoint field
- The endpoint change triggers the same behavior as manually entering an endpoint
- The new endpoint is used for all subsequent queries

**Behavior:**
- Clicking a button updates the endpoint textbox with the configured endpoint
- The endpoint change is immediate and doesn't require confirmation
- Multiple buttons can be displayed for different endpoints
- Each button shows its label for easy identification

### Configuration Import/Export

Backup, share, and migrate your YASGUI configuration using RDF Turtle format. This feature allows you to export all your settings, tabs, queries, and preferences, then import them on another device or browser.

[] a yasgui:Configuration ;
  yasgui:activeTab "tab1" ;
  yasgui:prefixes """PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>""" ;
  yasgui:autoCaptureEnabled "true"^^xsd:boolean ;
  yasgui:tab [
    yasgui:tabId "tab1" ;
    yasgui:tabName "My Query" ;
    yasgui:query "SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10" ;
    yasgui:endpoint "https://dbpedia.org/sparql" ;
    yasgui:requestMethod "POST"
  ] .
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Backup**: Export configuration before clearing browser data
- **Migration**: Move your setup to a different browser or device
- **Sharing**: Share query collections with colleagues
- **Version Control**: Track configuration changes over time
- **Collaboration**: Distribute standardized query setups to teams

**Important Notes:**
- Import will replace your current configuration (confirm before proceeding)
- Page reload is required to fully apply imported configuration
- Configuration is stored in browser's local storage
- Export includes all tabs and queries, but not query execution results

### URI Explorer

Quickly explore RDF resources by Ctrl+clicking on URIs in your query.

**How It Works:**
1. Hold `Ctrl` and click any URI in the query editor
2. YASGUI automatically generates and executes a CONSTRUCT query exploring:
   - Outgoing triples (where the URI is the subject)
   - Incoming triples (where the URI is the object)
3. Results appear without modifying your original query
4. View the resource's connections in the results viewer

**Example:**
Ctrl+clicking on `http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Union` automatically queries for all triples related to the European Union.

### Query Tabs

Manage multiple queries simultaneously with tabs.

**Features:**
- Create unlimited query tabs
- Rename tabs by double-clicking the tab name
- Duplicate tabs to create query variations
- Reorder tabs by dragging
- Close individual tabs
- Each tab maintains its own:
  - Query content
  - Endpoint configuration
  - Results
  - Plugin selection

**Tab Operations:**
- **New Tab**: Click the "+" button in the tab bar
- **Rename**: Double-click the tab name
- **Duplicate**: Right-click and select "Duplicate"
- **Close**: Click the "×" on the tab or use the context menu

All settings are saved automatically to local storage.

### SPARQL Endpoints Management

YASGUI automatically tracks all SPARQL endpoints you access and lets you manage them from a single location.

**Accessing the Endpoints Manager:**

1. **Open Settings**: Click the settings icon (⚙️) in the control bar
2. **Navigate to SPARQL Endpoints**: Click on the "SPARQL Endpoints" tab in the settings modal

**Managing Endpoints:**

The endpoints table shows:
- **Endpoint**: The URL of the SPARQL endpoint
- **Label**: Optional friendly name for the endpoint
- **Button**: Checkbox to show endpoint as a quick-switch button (requires label)
- **Authentication**: Configure HTTP Basic Authentication
- **Actions**: Delete endpoint from the list

**Adding Quick-Switch Buttons:**

1. Find your endpoint in the list
2. Enter a label (e.g., "DBpedia", "Wikidata")
3. Check the "Button" checkbox
4. The endpoint will now appear as a button in the control bar

**Configuring Authentication:**

YASGUI supports multiple authentication methods for endpoints that require credentials.

1. **Find your endpoint** in the SPARQL Endpoints table
2. **Click "Configure"** in the Authentication column
3. **Select authentication type**:
   - **HTTP Basic Authentication**: Username and password
   - **Bearer Token**: Pre-configured access token
   - **API Key**: Custom header with API key
   - **OAuth 2.0**: Industry-standard OAuth 2.0 authorization
4. **Enter credentials** based on your selected type (see below)
5. **Click "Save"** (or "Save & Authenticate" for OAuth 2.0) to apply

**Authentication Types:**

*HTTP Basic Authentication:*
- Username: Your endpoint username
- Password: Your endpoint password
- Use case: Simple username/password authentication

*Bearer Token:*
- Token: Your pre-configured bearer token
- Use case: When you have a pre-generated access token

*API Key (Custom Header):*
- Header Name: The HTTP header name (e.g., X-API-Key)
- API Key: Your API key value
- Use case: Endpoints using custom header-based authentication

*OAuth 2.0:*
- Client ID: Your OAuth application's client ID
- Authorization Endpoint: The OAuth provider's authorization URL
- Token Endpoint: The OAuth provider's token exchange URL
- Redirect URI: Callback URL (optional, defaults to current page)
- Scope: Space-separated OAuth scopes (optional)
- Use case: Secure, industry-standard authorization with automatic token refresh
- **Process**: Click "Save & Authenticate" to open OAuth login window

**Security Considerations:**

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

- **Credentials are stored in browser localStorage**: Your authentication credentials are stored locally in your browser
- **Only use with HTTPS endpoints**: Never send credentials to HTTP endpoints as they will be transmitted in plain text
- **Be cautious on shared computers**: Clear your browser data when using YASGUI on shared or public computers
- **OAuth 2.0 tokens**: Access tokens are automatically refreshed when expired (if refresh token is available)
- **Token security**: OAuth 2.0 uses secure PKCE flow (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security

**How Authentication Works:**

Authentication is stored per-endpoint, which means:
- All tabs using the same endpoint share the same credentials
- You only need to configure authentication once per endpoint
- Credentials persist across browser sessions (stored in localStorage)

When authentication is configured:

For **Basic Authentication**:
1. YASGUI encodes your credentials using Base64 encoding
2. Adds an `Authorization` header with the format: `Basic <encoded-credentials>`
3. Sends this header with every SPARQL query request to that endpoint

For **Bearer Token**:
1. Uses the provided token as-is
2. Adds an `Authorization` header with the format: `Bearer <token>`
3. Sends this header with every SPARQL query request to that endpoint

For **API Key**:
1. Uses the specified custom header name and API key value
2. Adds a custom header with the format: `<Header-Name>: <api-key>`
3. Sends this header with every SPARQL query request to that endpoint

For **OAuth 2.0**:
1. Opens a popup window for OAuth provider authentication
2. Uses Authorization Code flow with PKCE for secure token exchange
3. Stores access token and refresh token
4. Automatically checks token expiration before each query
5. Automatically refreshes expired tokens using refresh token (if available)
6. Adds an `Authorization` header with the format: `Bearer <access-token>`
7. If token refresh fails, prompts user to re-authenticate

### Query History and Persistence

YASGUI automatically saves your work locally.

**What's Saved:**
- Query text in each tab
- Tab names and order
- Endpoint configurations
- Last query results
- User preferences (theme, layout, etc.)
- Custom endpoint buttons

**Persistence Duration:**
- Default: 30 days
- Configurable by administrators

**Note:** Data is stored in your browser's local storage. Clearing browser data will remove saved queries.

### Share Queries

Share your queries with colleagues using URL parameters.

**How to Share:**
YASGUI supports URL-based query sharing:
1. Craft your query in YASGUI
2. The URL updates to include query parameters
3. Share the URL with others
4. Recipients see your query pre-loaded when they visit the link

**URL Parameters:**
- `query`: The SPARQL query
- `endpoint`: The endpoint URL

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Query Not Executing

**Symptoms:**
- Click Execute but nothing happens
- No results appear

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Query Syntax**: Look for red error indicators in the editor
2. **Verify Endpoint**: Ensure the endpoint URL is correct and accessible
3. **Check Browser Console**: Open browser developer tools (F12) for error messages
4. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure you're online
5. **Try a Simple Query**: Execute a basic query to test the endpoint:
   ```sparql
   SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 1
   ```

#### CORS Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Error message about "Cross-Origin Request Blocked"
- Query works in other tools but not in YASGUI

**Explanation:**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature. Some SPARQL endpoints don't allow browser-based queries from different domains.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Endpoint CORS Policy**: Contact the endpoint administrator
2. **Use CORS Proxy**: Configure a CORS proxy in YASGUI settings (if provided by administrator)
3. **Use Desktop/Server Version**: Run YASGUI locally or server-side where CORS doesn't apply
4. **Server-Side Proxy**: Query through a backend service

#### Local Endpoint Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot connect to localhost or 127.0.0.1 endpoints
- "Mixed content blocked" or similar errors
- Permission denied when querying local server

**Explanation:**
Browsers block HTTP requests to local endpoints from HTTPS pages (mixed content policy). This is a security feature to prevent malicious websites from accessing your local services.

**Solutions:**
1. **Run YASGUI Locally with Docker** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 mathiasvda/yasgui
   ```
   - Eliminates all permission issues
   - Both YASGUI and local endpoint use HTTP
   - See [Running YASGUI with Docker](#running-yasgui-with-docker) for details
2. **Grant Browser Permission**: 
   - Click "Allow" when the browser prompts for permission
   - See [Querying Local Endpoints](#querying-local-endpoints) for detailed instructions with screenshots
3. **Check Permission Settings**:
   - Click the lock/info icon in the address bar
   - Find "Insecure content" or "Mixed content" setting
   - Change to "Allow" and reload
4. **Verify Local Server is Running**:
   - Open `http://localhost:PORT/` in a new tab
   - Ensure you see your SPARQL endpoint's interface
5. **Check Port Number**: Common SPARQL ports are 3030 (Fuseki), 7200 (GraphDB), 3333 (Blazegraph)
6. **Try 127.0.0.1**: If `localhost` doesn't work, try `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/`
7. **Enable CORS on Local Server**: Configure your SPARQL server to allow CORS requests
8. **Use HTTPS for Local Endpoint**: Set up SSL/TLS on your local server (advanced)

**Browser-Specific Notes:**
- **Edge/Chrome/Vivaldi**: Look for shield icon in address bar to manage blocked content
- **Firefox**: May need to adjust `security.mixed_content.block_active_content` in about:config
- **Safari**: Enable "Disable local file restrictions" in Develop menu

#### Slow Queries

**Symptoms:**
- Query takes very long to execute
- Browser becomes unresponsive

**Solutions:**
1. **Add LIMIT Clause**: Restrict result size:
   ```sparql
   SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 100
   ```
2. **Optimize Query**: Make query more specific with filters
3. **Check Endpoint Status**: Endpoint might be under heavy load
4. **Break Into Smaller Queries**: Split complex queries into simpler parts
5. **Use Query Timeout**: Set a reasonable timeout in settings

#### Results Not Displaying Correctly

**Symptoms:**
- Results appear but look wrong
- Visualization doesn't show expected data

**Solutions:**
1. **Try Different Plugin**: Switch between Table, Response, and other plugins
2. **Check Response Plugin**: View raw response to verify data structure
3. **Check Data Format**: Ensure query returns expected format for the plugin
4. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and reload YASGUI
5. **Check Browser Compatibility**: Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

#### Autocomplete Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- No suggestions appear when typing
- Ctrl+Space does nothing

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Internet Connection**: Prefix suggestions require network access
2. **Wait for Typing Pause**: Autocomplete appears after a brief delay
3. **Position Cursor Correctly**: Autocomplete context-dependent (prefixes, keywords, etc.)
4. **Manually Trigger**: Press `Ctrl+Space` to force autocomplete

#### Lost Queries

**Symptoms:**
- Previous queries disappeared
- Tabs missing after reload

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Browser Storage**: Ensure browser allows local storage
2. **Avoid Private/Incognito Mode**: These modes don't persist local storage
3. **Check Storage Limits**: Browser might have cleared old data
4. **Export Important Queries**: Save critical queries externally
5. **Use Bookmarks**: Bookmark queries as URLs for safekeeping
6. **Same browser**: Use the same browser and profile to access YASGUI

#### Theme/Layout Not Saving

**Symptoms:**
- Theme reverts to default on reload
- Layout orientation doesn't persist

**Solutions:**
1. **Enable Local Storage**: Check browser settings
2. **Check Private Mode**: Use normal browser mode
3. **Clear and Reset**: Clear browser data, reconfigure preferences
4. **Check Browser Compatibility**: Ensure modern browser with localStorage support

#### Formatting Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Format button doesn't work
- Query becomes malformed after formatting

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Query Syntax**: Formatter requires valid SPARQL
2. **Try Different Formatter**: Switch between sparql-formatter and legacy in Settings
3. **Manual Formatting**: Format query manually if auto-format fails
4. **Report Invalid Results**: If formatter produces incorrect output, it's a bug

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. **Check GitHub Issues**: Visit [YASGUI Issues](https://github.com/Matdata-eu/Yasgui/issues)

4. **Community Support**: Engage with the YASGUI community

### Best Practices

**For Reliable Querying:**
- Always use `LIMIT` when exploring new data
- Test complex queries incrementally
- Save important queries outside the browser
- Use meaningful tab names
- Keep YASGUI updated (if self-hosted)
- Monitor endpoint status pages
- Use appropriate query types (SELECT vs CONSTRUCT)

**For Better Performance:**
- Format queries for readability
- Use specific property paths instead of `?p`
- Add filters early in query patterns
- Avoid `SELECT *` on large datasets
- Close unused tabs
- Clear old results periodically
